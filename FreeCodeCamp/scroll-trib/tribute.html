                Jeffery Lamar Williams, born August 16, 1991. Better known since 2011 as Young Thug. This young man from Zone 3 Atlanta, GA caught the attention of fellow ATLien Gucci Mane with his mixtapes <strong><em>I Came from Nothing Vols 1-3</em></strong>.
            <br/>
            <br/> After signing to his label 1017 Brick Squad Records (an Atlantic imprint), Thugger's success began its <strong>meteoric rise</strong>. His first project on the label landed him on year-end lists by Complex, Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, and The Guardian. His songs were soon being remixed by major rappers and he was a bonafide up-and-coming star.
            <br/><br/>
            Soon enough, other labels started to pursue His Thugness, including Future's Freebandz and Cash Money Records. In the end, he signed to a management deal with Birdman's Rich Gang, while remaining on Brick Squad. In 2014, he featured on the <strong>chart-topping banger <em>Lifestyle.</em></strong> However, not everyone was happy with his success.

            Young Thug became embroiled in a tumultuous friendship-turned-rivalry with his mentor and idol, Lil' Wayne. To some extent, this may have simply been Thugmeister getting caught in between the already escalating tensions between Weezy and Birdman; but after deciding to name his debut album Tha Carter 6 (later changed to Barter 6), Wayne could not take it anymore. This beef seemingly ended with Lil' Wayne's tour van getting shot at, allegedly by an associate of Young Thug. Since then, the tensions have cooled, with Young Thug deciding to release Barter 6 as a mixtape and naming his debut album <strong><em>Hy!&pound;UN35</em></strong> (aka "Hitunes": release date TBA).
            <br/><br/>
            Young Thug was called a "rap weirdo" by XXL. Many consider his music to be <strong>avant-garde/experimental hip-hop</strong>. He is known for his extreme vocal scatting, his unhinged flow, and distinctive hooks. Beyond his music, he takes an alternative approach to his attire, often wearing women's clothing. At this point, he has cemented his impact in today's hip-hop world. His vocals were featured on Kanye's most recent album, Life of Pablo. With his debut album, coming out soon, it will be interesting to see how much higher his star can rise.
